# CoolFoursquareBro #

This is a python twitter bot, inspired by the following tweet by the ever-amusing [@iamdevloper](https://twitter.com/iamdevloper): 

[![@iamdevloper](http://barryoneill.github.io/CoolFoursquareBro/coolfoursquarebro_tweetref.png)](https://twitter.com/iamdevloper/statuses/400696778196275200)

This module queries the target user's recent tweets, and if any are determined to be foursquare 
noise, they get responded to in the manner above (the messages are configurable!)

### Disclaimer ###

I wrote this script to get a bit more python practice, and also to have a bit of fun with a friend 
who's a foursquare fan  (and has a good sense of humour).  It's up to you to make sure that you
**don't use this script in a spammy/harassing way.  Also ensure that you call it in a way that obeys 
[Twitter's T&C](https://dev.twitter.com/terms/api-terms)**. :hear_no_evil:   


### Requirements ###

* Python 2.5 to 2.7 (the python-twitter module isn't fully Python 3 ready yet) 
* The [python-twitter](https://github.com/bear/python-twitter) module which has its own dependencies:
	* [SimpleJson](http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/simplejson), [Requests OAuthlib](https://requests-oauthlib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), [HTTPLib2](http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/), [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)
* If you wish to use the provided **runner.py** script, you'll also need [PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org/).
* If you don't already have one, you'll need to setup your twitter developer account.  
	* Sign into the [developer apps dashboard](https://dev.twitter.com/apps) with the bot's twitter account.  
	* Create a new 'Application'.  Under the **Settings** tab, make sure the *Application Type* is 'Read and Write'.  
  	* Back in the **Details** tab, click the **Create My Access Token** button.  You'll need the values on
  	  this page for your configuration (below). 



### Usage ###

```python

	from coolfoursquarebro import CoolFoursquareBro

    conf = {
        # [required] taken from your twitter developer app page
        'twitter_consumer_key': 'abcde12345abcde12345',
        'twitter_consumer_secret': 'abcde12345abcde12345abcde12345abcde12345',
        'twitter_access_token': 'abcde12345abcde12345abcde12345abcde12345abcde12345',
        'twitter_access_token_secret': 'abcde12345abcde12345abcde12345abcde12345abcde123',

        # [required] stores the last seen tweet info (created on first run)
        'db': '/tmp/file.db',

        # [required] the victim's twitter id (use http://gettwitterid.com/ to look up)
        'target_userid': 12345678,

        # [optional] useful for first run/testing, prevents responses to tweets older than this id
        # 'lastseen_startval': 0,

        # [optional] default response text text
        'coolstory_responsedefault': 'cool story, bro',

        # [optional] if the tweet text contains one of these keys, the value will be used instead
        'coolstory_responses': {
            'McDonald\'s': 'cool diet, bro',
            'deli': 'cool sandwich, bro'
        }
    }

	
    bot = CoolFoursquareBro(conf)
	 	
    bot.cool_story_bro()  # dry_run=True for testing 
}

```

### Scheduling the Bot ###

While the above could be shoved in a *while*/*sleep* loop, I also wrote **runner.py** to run the
bot from a cron job, reading the config from a file and doing appropriate logging. 

Here's a sample cron entry to run the bot every 2 minutes (watch out for 
[Twitter's rate limiting rules](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/rate-limiting/1.1)!):

	*/2 * * * * /usr/bin/python /path/to/runner.py >> /path/to/runner.log 2>&1
	
It will look for a file called **coolfoursquarebro.yaml** in your home directory, 
but you may override that with the **-c /path/to/config.yaml** argument.   The configuration 
is the same as the hardcoded dictionary in the above code snippet, except that it's  in yaml format:

	# [required] taken from your twitter developer app page
	twitter_consumer_key: abcde12345abcde12345
	twitter_consumer_secret: abcde12345abcde12345abcde12345abcde12345
	twitter_access_token: abcde12345abcde12345abcde12345abcde12345abcde12345
	twitter_access_token_secret: abcde12345abcde12345abcde12345abcde12345abcde123
	
	# [required] stores the last seen tweet info (created on first run)
	db: /tmp/file.db
	
	# [required] the victim's twitter id (use http://gettwitterid.com/ to look up)
	target_userid: 12345678
	
	# [optional] useful on the first run, prevents responses to tweets older than this id
	# lastseen_startval: 0
	
	# [optional] default response text text
	coolstory_responsedefault: cool story, bro
	
	# [optional] if the tweet text contains one of these keys, the value will be used instead
	coolstory_responses:
	  McDonald's: cool diet, bro
	  deli: cool sandwich, bro
